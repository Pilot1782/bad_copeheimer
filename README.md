`/help`
This shows all of the commands you can use and their usage. Then to create your server list, run:

`/find`
This will look through your database to find servers that match the provided paramaters. In the new build, there are two more buttons that can be used to either show the player names and uuids of players found on the server or to pick another random server from the list, after pressing it, wait for the message to update.

If the server has a whitelist the dot will be orange if it is online.

#### Important

In order for /status to work properly the server should have enable-query=true in the server.properties file. This allows the server to brodcast who is currently logged onto the server.
